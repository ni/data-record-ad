# Custom Data
## Overview
One of the main tasks of the Data Record AD framework is to serve as a data repository.  IO plugins can write or read various data types to/from the engine.  
Installing the Data Record AD Development Suite installs various LabVIEW libraries to assist with the development of IO plugins, including CustomData.lvlib.
