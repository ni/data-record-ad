# Branches

All development work will be completed in a branch.  The branch will follow the naming convention _users/<firstinitiallastname>/<task>_.  For example, if a developer named John Smith creates an IO plugin for acquisition of a thermocouple, a valid branch name is _users/jsmith/IOpluginThermocoupleAcq_.

# Plugins

Submit a PR for your plugin. Fill out the PR template and attach a log of your tests running locally.

# Documentation

Submit a new Markdown document in the /docs folder or edit an existing one via Pull Request.
1. Run your document through a spell checker.
2. When describing actions a user should take, use the following template: 
- Task topic template: 
  -	Task title
  -	Pre-requisites
  -	Equipment list
  -	Steps to complete task, including applicable images
  -	Post-requisites 
3. When describing concepts, a screenshot is worth a thousand words. 

## Documentation Style
-	Use the present tense (i.e. "The Plug-In Creation Toolkit includes tools and templates...") 
-	Make it clear whether actions are an automated part of the system or if some action is required on the part of the user. 
-	Directly address the user using imperatives in procedures (i.e. "Inspect the interior of the chassis")
-	Keep user goals in mind and gear content towards those goals. Address the "why" and "how" of the action they should be performing or the concept they should be learning.
